Version 0.91 - 20230922-1818:

- First public alpha

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

* UltimateII+ (U2+) cartridge installed on a real C64, or an Ultimate 64.
- Firmware at version 3.4 or higher (to have access to the UCI DRVINFO command, link to firmware page, scroll down for U2 firmware: <https://ultimate64.com/Firmware> )

### Installation

* Download the ZIP file with the latest build

* In the ZIP file you will find these instructions and a .crt file, the latter is the cartridge image containing the UBoot64 software. Unzip contents to a temporary location.

* Transfer this .crt file to the /Flash/Carts directory on your Ultimate device. Either transfer to this directory on your Ultimate device via FTP, or place it somewhere on the USB storage Ultimate device, browse to it in the UI filebrowser, press C= + C to copy, navigate to the /Flash/Carts dir and paste by C= + V/.

![Ultimate UI select cart](https://github.com/xahmol/UBoot64/blob/main/Screenshots/UBoot64%20-%20UI%20set%20cart.png?raw=true)

- Do a power cycke of your device. The UBoot64 software should now automatically start on starting your Ultimate device.

- Stop autostarting of UBoot64 by deselecting the cartridge via the same procedure and selecting **None** or another image as cartridge.

**First run:**

* At first run no configuration file is present yet for the menu, so only the default menu options are visible:
![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20firstrunmenu.png)
* For instructions of the menu options: see below.

**Add start options via the Filebrowser**

* Start options can be added to menuslots 0-9 and A-Z via the Filebrowser. This can be either running an executable program, or booting a specific disk image.
* For this, first choose **F1** for filebrowser.  You will get a screen like this:

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20filebrowsermenu.png)

* Full instructions for the filebrowser are below. Here only the quick instructions to add an option to the startmenu.
* Select your desired drive target by switching pressing **+** or **-** to increase resp. decrease the device number until the desired device number is selected.
* Refresh directory by **F1** if needed (empty column)
* Start a directory trace by pressing **D**
  

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20highlightdirtrace.png)

  This starts a trace of your movements through the directory tree, starting from the root directory of your device. You should see the directory refreshing to this root directory.
  You should also see the TRACE toggle switched to ON in the lower right corner of the screen.

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20toggledirtraceon.png).

* Also note the other two toggles Frc 8 and FAST: these are toggled by pressing the **8** and **F** keys.

  ![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20highlightforce8andfast.png)

* Force 8: This forces the device ID to be loaded from to 8 regardless of the device ID the target is located at. Only works for the U2+ Software IEC drive (identified as U64 in the lowest line of the directory column). This enables loading software that is not supporting other parts of the program from other device IDs as 8
* FAST: this starts the program in FAST mode. Only use if the target is started in 80 column mode and the target supports it.
* Browse to your desired target via the **Cursor keys**: **UP/DOWN/LEFT?RIGHT** to move within the directory, **P** for page down and **U** for a page up, **ENTER** on a directory or disk image to enter the selected directory or image, **DEL** to change to parent directory.
* To choose to have a program executed from the menuslot, select **ENTER** or **F7** on the desired executable
* To have the program executed in C64 mode from the menuslot, select **6** on the desired executable

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/blob/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20filebrowsermenu_run64.png?raw=true)

* To choose to boot the image you are now in from the menuslot, select **F5**.
* To select a highlighted disk image (so a directory entry with an .dXX extension), press **A** or **B** to add this image to a menuslot as to be mounted on starting from that slot on the Ultimate emulated drive A resp. B. Then select the target menuslot, edit the name if desired, and enter the device ID for the image.

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/blob/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20filebrowsermenu_addmount.png?raw=true)

* To select the highligjhted program file to be started from the disk image mounted in drive A instead of from the hyperspeed drive, select the program by pressing **M** (instead of ENTER). Then select the target menuslot, edit the name if desired.

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/blob/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20filebrowsermenu_runmount.png?raw=true)

* To add a REU file to be loaded at the start of a menu option: navigate to the desired REU file and press 'ENTER'.
Then select the target menuslot, edit the name if desired, choose the REU size via '+' and '-' and press 'ENTER' to confirm.
**NOTE**: The REU file needs to be in the same filepath as the drive image for disk A if that one is present (not storage space available for another path to store).

* No validation if the configuration is correct or coherent is done, so setting up valid configurations is the users responsibility, Only very limited error handling on executing incorrectly configured menu slots is done. Mounts and REU file can be added or changed (by adding again and overwriting the previous one), but not deleted separately. To do so, the whole entry needs to be deleted. Adding disk images to mount, a REU file and choosing the file to start require all separate dirtrace actions in the filebrowser, so setting up a menuslot might take up to four entries to the filebrowser and navigating via dirtrace.

* After selecting what should be placed in a menuslot option, you should get this screen to select the menuslot position:

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/raw/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20choosemenuslot.png)

* If this slot is already (partly) filled, confirmation is asked. Choose Yes to proceed or No to Cancel.

![](https://github.com/xahmol/DMBoot/blob/main/pictures/dmboot%20-%20choosemenuslot-notempty.png?raw=true)

* Choose **0-9** or **A-Z** key to choose the desired slot.
* Enter the desired name for the menuslot and press **ENTER**
* You now return to the main menu where you should see the menu option appearing.
* Repeat until you have selected all desired menuslot options

**F1: Filebrowse menu**

The filebrowser based and insprired by the DraBrowse program from <https://github.com/doj/dracopy>
